# E-Learning

The E-Learning section contains training material about how to use the Earth observation (EO) cloud resources provided by EO-Lab and CODE-DE. The material is intended for different skill levels in working with EO data, reaching from EO beginners over EO experts to developers that apply Artificial Intelligence for EO processing. 

The course material folders specifically contain
* Deep Learning
  * The index.html and associated files for the training material of the course "Deep Learning for EO data processing on the EO Cloud with TensorFlow"
  * The script "EO-Lab_Tensorflow_script_example.ipynb"
  * The script "EO-Lab_Pytorch_script_example.ipynb"
  * Datasets used for script testing in the subfolder "Example_Data"

To get the most out of the training material, it is recommended to access it via the courses on the E-Learning platform https://e-learning.eo-lab.org/.
